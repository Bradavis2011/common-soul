To: sarah@moonlighthealing.com
Subject: Sarah, join Common Soul's spiritual healing community

Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you in good health and spirit. I came across your
beautiful Reiki, Crystal Healing, Energy Work practice on Instagram and was deeply
inspired by your authentic approach to healing.

My name is Brandon, and I'm reaching out because I believe you'd be a perfect
fit for Common Soul - a new spiritual healing platform that connects authentic
practitioners like yourself with seekers who truly value genuine healing experiences.

Why Common Soul is Different:
‚Ä¢ Quality Over Quantity: We carefully vet both healers and seekers
‚Ä¢ Fair Revenue Sharing: Keep 85% of your session fees
‚Ä¢ Complete Support: Integrated booking, payments, messaging, and video sessions
‚Ä¢ Authentic Community: Connect with like-minded practitioners

We're currently building our founding community of healers in Boulder, CO and
would be honored to have someone with your expertise join us.

[Learn More About Common Soul Button]

I'd love to answer any questions you might have about the platform.

With gratitude and light,
Brandon Davis
Founder, Common Soul
