## 🔧 Railway Database Connection Details (For Next Session)
- **Project**: empowering-celebration
- **Backend Service**: backend-production-5e29.up.railway.app
- **Postgres Service**: postgres-production-596d.up.railway.app
- **Database**: railway
- **Current DATABASE_URL**: postgresql://postgres:QGpZTJUVKjtNggsZUuHfLJiPVkWVgAcx@postgres.railway.internal:5432/railway

## 🚨 Known Issues to Address:
1. Prisma cannot connect to Railway PostgreSQL from both internal and external URLs
2. Database tables not created - all API endpoints returning "Internal server error"
3. Need alternative approach to deploy schema (possibly Railway dashboard or different migration strategy)
